transition table generator in c++
vector<states> = set of all states, preload from file
vector<inputs> = set of all inputs, preload from file
unordered_map<state we are in, input> = set of reachable states <- this is the transition table..


while(there is more states to evaluate){
  for(set of all inputs :into: state){
    //consider the set of all states we can reach as one clustered state
    new_state = unordered_map[state][input];
    if(vector<states> does not contain new_state){
      vector<states>.push_back(new_state);
    }
  }
}

for(all original states from vector){
  if(set of reachable states created by transition table does not contain old state from vector) -> remove old state.. it is unreachable
}
